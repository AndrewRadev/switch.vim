INSTALLATION                                               *switch-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone git://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/switch
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add git://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim.git bundle/switch
<

Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~/.vim
directory: plugin, autoload, doc.

USAGE                                                     *switch-usage* *:Switch*

TODO other plugins

The main entry point of the plugin is a single command, |:Switch|. When the
command is executed, the plugin looks for one of a few specific patterns under
the cursor and performs a substition depending on the pattern. For example, if
the cursor is on the "true" in the following code:
>
    flag = true
<
Then, upon executing |:Switch|, the "true" will turn into "false".

It is highly recommended to map the |:Switch| command to a key. For example,
to map it to "-", place the following in your .vimrc:
>
    nnoremap - :Switch<cr>
<
There are three main principles that the substition follows:

1. The cursor needs to be on the match. Regardless of the pattern, the plugin
   only performs the substition if the cursor is positioned in the matched
   text.

2. When several patterns match, the shortest match is performed. For example,
   in ruby, the following switch is defined:

>
    { :foo => true }
    # switches into:
    { foo: true }
<

   This works if the cursor is positioned somewhere on the ":foo =>" part, but
   if it's on top of "true", the abovementioned true -> false substition will
   be performed instead. If you want to perform a "larger" substition instead,
   you could move your cursor away from the "smaller" match. In this case,
   move the cursor away from the "true" keyword.

3. When several patterns with the same size match, the order of the
   definitions is respected. For instance, in eruby, the following code can be
   transformed:

>
    <% if foo? %>
    # could switch into:
    <%# if foo? %>
    # but instead, it would switch into:
    <% if true and (foo?) %>
<

   The second switch will be performed, simply because in the definition list,
   the pattern was placed at a higher spot. In this case, this seems to make
   sense to prioritize one over the other. If it's needed to prioritize in a
   different way, the definition list should be redefined by the user -- see
   |switch-customization|.

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION                                             *switch-customization*

There are two variables that hold the global definition list and the
buffer-local definition list -- |g:switch_definitions| and
|b:switch_definitions|, respectively. In order to customize these to perform
the switches you want, you can directly override them. For their default
contents, please see the file plugin/switch.vim.

The format of the variables is a simple List of items. Each item can be either
a List or a Dict. Example for a List:

>
    let g:switch_definitions =
        \ [
        \   ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
        \ ]
<
With this definition list, if the plugin encounters "foo" under the cursor, it
will be changed to "bar". If it sees "bar", it will change it to "baz", and
"baz" would be turned into "foo". This is the simple case of a definition that
is implemented (in a slightly different way) by the "toggle.vim" plugin.

The more complicated (and more powerful) way to define a switch pattern is by
using a Dict:
>
    autocmd FileType eruby let b:switch_definitions =
        \ [
        \   {
        \     ':\(\k\+\)\s\+=>': '\1:',
        \     '\<\(\k\+\):':     ':\1 =>',
        \   },
        \ ]
<
When in the eruby filetype, the hash will take effect. The plugin will look
for something that looks like ":foo =>" and replace it with "foo: ", or the
reverse -- "foo: ", so it could turn it into ":foo =>". The search string is
fed to the |search()| function, so all special patterns like |\%l| have effect
in it. And the replacement string is used in the |:substitute| command, so all
of its replacement patterns work as well.

Notice the use of "autocmd FileType eruby" to set the buffer-local variable
whenever an eruby file is loaded. The same effect could be achieved by placing
this definition in ftplugin/eruby.vim.

Another interesting example is the following definition:
>
    autocmd FileType php let b:switch_definitions =
        \ [
        \   { '<?php echo \(.*\) ?>': '<?php \1 ?>' },
        \   { '<?php \(.*\) ?>':      '<?php echo \1 ?>' },
        \ ]
<
In this case, when in the php filetype, the |b:switch_definitions| variable
will hold two dictionaries of transformations. Due to the first definition, if
the plugin encounters something like: "<?php echo 'OK' ?>", it will turn into
"<?php 'OK' ?>", and due to the second definition, the reverse transformation
would occur. This is split into two definitions to ensure that the one with
"echo" in it is checked first -- the second one would match the same text as
well. It's good to have such cases in mind when designing switches.
