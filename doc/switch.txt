INSTALLATION                                               *switch-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone git://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/switch
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add git://github.com/AndrewRadev/switch.vim.git bundle/switch
<

Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~/.vim
directory: plugin, autoload, doc.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                      *switch-usage* *:Switch* *:SwitchReverse*

The main entry point of the plugin is a single command, |:Switch|. When the
command is executed, the plugin looks for one of a few specific patterns under
the cursor and performs a substition depending on the pattern. For example, if
the cursor is on the "true" in the following code:
>
    flag = true
<
Then, upon executing |:Switch|, the "true" will turn into "false".

There's a default mapping to trigger the command, `gs`. Note that this is
already a Vim built-in (|gs|), but it doesn't seem particularly useful.

If you'd like to change the mapping, change the value of |g:switch_mapping|.
For example, to map it to "-", place the following in your .vimrc:
>
    let g:switch_mapping = "-"
<
To avoid the default mapping completely, set the variable to an empty string:
>
    let g:switch_mapping = ""
<
See |switch-customization| below for information on how to create several
mappings with different definitions.

The same holds true for the secondary command, |:SwitchReverse|. For
definitions that are built as lists (for example, ["one", "two", "three"]),
this command works the same way in the opposite direction. So, with the
example definition, executing |:Switch| on "two" would result in "three", but
executing |:SwitchReverse| on "two" would change it to "one.

Again, for dictionary switches, this command will work exactly like |:Switch|.

The mapping that controls the reverse switch is |g:switch_reverse_mapping|,
and it's unset by default (no mapping is defined).
>
    let g:switch_reverse_mapping = '+'
<

There are three main principles that the substition follows:

1. The cursor needs to be on the match. Regardless of the pattern, the plugin
   only performs the substition if the cursor is positioned in the matched
   text.

2. When several patterns match, the shortest match is performed. For example,
   in ruby, the following switch is defined:

>
    { :foo => true }
    # switches into:
    { foo: true }
<

   This works if the cursor is positioned somewhere on the ":foo =>" part, but
   if it's on top of "true", the abovementioned true -> false substition will
   be performed instead. If you want to perform a "larger" substition instead,
   you could move your cursor away from the "smaller" match. In this case,
   move the cursor away from the "true" keyword.

3. When several patterns with the same size match, the order of the
   definitions is respected. For instance, in eruby, the following code can be
   transformed:

>
    <% if foo? %>
    # could switch into:
    <%# if foo? %>
    # but instead, it would switch into:
    <% if true or (foo?) %>
<

   The second switch will be performed, simply because in the definition list,
   the pattern was placed at a higher spot. In this case, this seems to make
   sense to prioritize one over the other. If it's needed to prioritize in a
   different way, the definition list should be redefined by the user -- see
   |switch-customization|.

If you don't like the "smallest match" algorithm described on top, and you'd
rather just attempt all matches in order, set the value of
|g:switch_find_smallest_match| to 0.


==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION                                             *switch-customization*

There are two variables that hold the global definition list and the
buffer-local definition list -- |g:switch_definitions| and
|b:switch_definitions|, respectively. These contain the definitions for the
built-ins provided by the plugin. In order to add the switches you want, you
should override |g:switch_custom_definitions| and
|b:switch_custom_definitions| instead.

The format of all of these variables is a simple List of items. Each item can
be either a List or a Dict.

List definitions ~
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
        \ ]
<
With this definition list, if the plugin encounters "foo" under the cursor, it
will be changed to "bar". If it sees "bar", it will change it to "baz", and
"baz" would be turned into "foo". This is the simple case of a definition that
is implemented (in a slightly different way) by the "toggle.vim" plugin.

You might want this to work for different capitalizations, like with `true`
and `True` and `TRUE`. While you could use the more complicated dict
definition, a simple way to tackle this is to use the `switch#NormalizedCase`
helper:
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   switch#NormalizedCase(['one', 'two'])
        \ ]
<
This would switch between "one" and "two", between "One" and "Two", and
between "ONE" and "TWO". This is not the default, since you might want to
change casing in your switches. See |switch-internals| for some information on
the underlying data format if you'd like to use a different method to
generate definitions (like, say, loading JSON).

Leaving lists aside, the more complicated (and more powerful) way to define a
switch pattern is by using a Dict. In fact, a list definition is processed
into three dict definitions, one for each pair of switches.

Dict definitions ~
>
    autocmd FileType eruby let b:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   {
        \     ':\(\k\+\)\s\+=>': '\1:',
        \     '\<\(\k\+\):':     ':\1 =>',
        \   },
        \ ]
<
When in the eruby filetype, the hash will take effect. The plugin will look
for something that looks like ":foo =>" and replace it with "foo: ", or the
reverse -- "foo: ", so it could turn it into ":foo =>". The search string is
fed to the |search()| function, so all special patterns like |\%l| have effect
in it. And the replacement string is used in the |:substitute| command, so all
of its replacement patterns work as well.

Notice the use of "autocmd FileType eruby" to set the buffer-local variable
whenever an eruby file is loaded. The same effect could be achieved by placing
the "let" clause in ftplugin/eruby.vim instead.

Another interesting example is the following definition:
>
    autocmd FileType php let b:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   {
        \     '<?php echo \(.\{-}\) ?>':        '<?php \1 ?>',
        \     '<?php \%(echo\)\@!\(.\{-}\) ?>': '<?php echo \1 ?>',
        \   }
        \ ]
<
In this case, when in the "php" filetype, the plugin will attempt to remove
the "echo" in "<?php echo 'something' ?>" or vice-versa. However, the second
pattern wouldn't work properly if it didn't contain "\%(echo\)\@!". This
pattern asserts that, in this place of the text, there is no "echo".
Otherwise, the second pattern would match as well. Using the |\@!| pattern in
strategic places is important in many cases.

For even more complicated substitions, you can use the nested form.

Nested dict definitions ~

The following expression replaces underscored identifier names with their
camelcased versions.

>
    let b:switch_custom_definitions = [
        \   {
        \     '\<[a-z0-9]\+_\k\+\>': {
        \       '_\(.\)': '\U\1'
        \     },
        \     '\<[a-z0-9]\+[A-Z]\k\+\>': {
        \       '\([A-Z]\)': '_\l\1'
        \     },
        \   }
        \ ]
<

If the cursor is on "foo_bar_baz", then switching would produce "fooBarBaz"
and vice-versa. The logic is as follows:

    - The keys of the dict are patterns, just like the "normal" dict version.
    - The values of the dict are dicts with patterns for keys and replacements
      for values.

The goal of this form is to enable substituting several different kinds of
patterns within the limits of another one. In this example, there's no way to
define this switch using the simpler form, since there's an unknown number of
underscores in the variable name and all of them need to be replaced in order
to make the switch complete.

The nested patterns differ from the simple one in that each one of them is
replaced globally, only within the limits of the "parent" pattern.

Note that this particular example is NOT included as a built-in, since it may
overshadow other ones and is probably not that useful, either (it's rare that
a language would require changing between the two forms). An example usage may
be within javascript, if your server-side variables are underscored and the
client-side ones need to be camelcased. For something more complete, you can
take a look at this gist: https://gist.github.com/othree/5655583.

You could also use a separate mapping for that.

Separate mappings ~

While there's a default mapping for |:Switch|, you could actually define
several mappings with your own custom definitions:
>
    let g:variable_style_switch_definitions = [
        \   {
        \     '\<[a-z0-9]\+_\k\+\>': {
        \       '_\(.\)': '\U\1'
        \     },
        \     '\<[a-z0-9]\+[A-Z]\k\+\>': {
        \       '\([A-Z]\)': '_\l\1'
        \     },
        \   }
        \ ]
    nnoremap + :call switch#Switch(g:variable_style_switch_definitions)<cr>
    nnoremap - :Switch<cr>
<
With this, typing "-" would invoke the built-in switch definitions, while
typing "+" would switch between camelcase and underscored variable styles.
This may be particularly useful if you have several clashing switches on
patterns that match similar things.

Builtins ~

If you want to only use some built-in definitions, you can set the
|g:switch_no_builtins| variable to 1 and then just use your
|g:switch_custom_definitions| and |b:switch_custom_definitions| variables to
re-use the built-in definitions. To make this easier, you can use the
patterns from the |g:switch_builtins| list:
>
    autocmd FileType ruby let b:switch_definitions =
        \ [
        \   g:switch_builtins.ruby_hash_style,
        \
        \   { 'my_own_pattern': 'my_own_replacement' },
        \
        \   g:switch_builtins.rspec_should,
        \ ]
<
See the section below, |switch-builtins| for information on the built-in
patterns, including their names in the |g:switch_builtins| dictionary.

==============================================================================
BUILTINS                                                       *switch-builtins*

Here's a list of all the built-in switch definitions. To see the actual
definitions with their patterns and replacements, look at the file
plugin/switch.vim.

Global ~

Boolean conditions (g:switch_builtins.ampersands):
>
    foo && bar
    foo || bar

    flag = True
    flag = False
<

Ruby ~

Hash style (g:switch_builtins.ruby_hash_style):
>
    foo = { :one => 'two' }
    foo = { one: 'two' }
<
Lambdas (g:switch_builtins.ruby_lambda):
>
    lambda { |x, y| whatever(x, y) }
    ->(x, y) { whatever(x, y) }
<
If-clauses (g:switch_builtins.ruby_if_clause):
>
    if predicate?
      puts 'Hello, World!'
    end

    if true or (predicate?)
      puts 'Hello, World!'
    end

    if false and (predicate?)
      puts 'Hello, World!'
    end
<
RSpec should/should_not (g:switch_builtins.rspec_should):
>
    1.should eq 1
    1.should_not eq 1
<
RSpec expect (with the cursor on "expect") (g:switch_builtins.rspec_expect):
>
    expect(1).to eq 1
    expect(1).not_to eq 1
<
RSpec to_/not_to (with the cursor on "to/not_to") (g:switch_builtins.rspec_to):
>
    expect { raise "OK" }.to raise_error
    expect { raise "OK" }.not_to raise_error
<
RSpec be_truthy/be_falsey (g:switch_builtins.rspec_be_truthy_falsey):

    expect(true).to be_truthy
    expect(true).to be_falsey
<
Ruby string style (g:switch_builtins.ruby_string):
>
    foo = 'bar'
    foo = "baz"
    foo = :baz
<
Note that it only works for single-word strings.

Ruby block shorthands (g:switch_builtins.ruby_short_blocks):

>
    ['one', 'two', 'three']
    %w(one two three)

    [:one, :two, :three]
    %i(one two three)
<
In this case, be careful to not have the cursor on one of the strings/symbols,
or you'll trigger the string switch as seen above.

"Echo" in tags (g:switch_builtins.php_echo):
>
    <?php "Text" ?>

    %a{href: '/example'}
<

C++ ~

Pointer dots/arrows (g:switch_builtins.cpp_pointer):
>
    Object* foo = bar.baz;
    Object* foo = bar->baz;
<

Javascript ~

    foo = {one: one, two}
<

Clojure ~

String style (g:switch_builtins.clojure_string):
>
    "baz"
    'bar
    :baz
<
Note that it only works for single-word strings, such as baz, b-a-z, or **.

If-clauses (g:switch_builtins.clojure_if_clause):
>
    (if predicate?
      (prn "Hello, world!")

      (prn "Hello, world!")
      (prn "oh..."))
<
Note that it also works for if-not, when, and when-not.

Scala ~

String style (g:switch_builtins.scala_string):
>
    "foo bar"
    s"foo bar"
    f"foo bar"
    """foo bar"""

    f"""foo bar"""
<

==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                       *switch-settings*

                                                              *g:switch_mapping*
>
    let g:switch_mapping = '-'
<

Default value: "gs"

This variable is the default mapping the plugin will use. Set it to "" to
avoid setting a default mapping. You can then use the |:Switch| command, or
create a mapping manually.

                                                      *g:switch_reverse_mapping*
>
    let g:switch_reverse_mapping = '+'
<

Default value: ""

This variable is the mapping to switch "in reverse", whenever that makes sense
(only for list definitions). This is not set by default, so no mapping is
defined. You can use |:SwitchReverse| even without the mapping.


                                                   *g:switch_custom_definitions*
>
    g:switch_custom_definitions
<

This variable contains your custom switch definitions -- patterns that are
attempted against every filetype. Changing the contents of this variable would
make the plugin attempt these patterns in addition to the built-ins.

Example:

Putting the following in .vimrc would make the plugin switch between "on" and
"off":
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions = [
          \   ['on', 'off']
          \ ]
<

                                                  *b:switch_custom_definitions*
>
    b:switch_custom_definitions
<

This variable contains your custom buffer-local switch definitions.

Example:

Putting the following in ftplugin/html.vim would switch between single-line
<div> and <span> tags, though it probably won't work in complicated cases.
>
    let b:switch_custom_definitions =
          \ [
          \   {
          \     '<div\(.\{-}\)>\(.\{-}\)</div>': '<span\1>\2</span>',
          \     '<span\(.\{-}\)>\(.\{-}\)</span>': '<div\1>\2</div>',
          \   }
          \ ]
<

                                                             *g:switch_builtins*
>
    g:switch_builtins
<

This variable contains all built-in switch definitions. It makes it simple to
re-use definitions for different filetypes and to cherry-pick original
functionality if needed.

For example, g:switch_builtins.ruby_hash_style contains a pattern that can be
used for ruby, eruby, slim and haml.


                                                          *g:switch_no_builtins*
>
    g:switch_no_builtins
<
If this variable is set, no builtins will be set by the plugin. This might be
useful to avoid any surprising switch definitions outside of your control. You
can still set your own definitions, of course, and you can re-use some
built-ins by taking them from the |g:switch_builtins| dict.


                                                  *g:switch_find_smallest_match*
>
    let g:switch_find_smallest_match = 0
<
This variable controls whether the plugin will attempt to find the smallest
match for the area under the cursor. If it's set to 0, all the different
matches will simply be attempted in the order they're defined.

==============================================================================
INTERNALS                                                     *switch-internals*

All List definitions are transformed into Dict definitions. So, for instance,
if you have this kind of list:
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
        \ ]
<
This is exactly equivalent to:
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   {'\Vfoo\m': 'bar'},
        \   {'\Vbar\m': 'baz'},
        \   {'\Vbaz\m': 'foo'},
        \ ]
<
The `switch#NormalizedCase` helper prepares a different transformation. If we
have a list like this:
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   switch#NormalizedCase(['one', 'two'])
        \ ]
<
That's first transformed into this format:
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   {
        \     '_type': 'normalized_case',
        \     '_definition': ['one', 'two'],
        \   }
        \ ]
<
Which then the plugin recognizes as a special case and processes like this:
>
    let g:switch_custom_definitions =
        \ [
        \   {'\Cone': 'two'}, {'\Ctwo': 'one'},
        \   {'\COne': 'Two'}, {'\CTwo': 'One'},
        \   {'\CONE': 'TWO'}, {'\CTWO': 'ONE'},
        \ ]
<
The plan is to have multiple different `_type` parameters which determine what
kind of processing to perform on the matchers.


==============================================================================
SIMILAR PLUGINS                                         *switch-similar-plugins*

This plugin is very similar to two other ones:
  - toggle.vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=895
  - cycle.vim: https://github.com/zef/vim-cycle

Both of these work on replacing a specific word under the cursor with a
different one. The benefit of switch.vim is that it works for much more
complicated patterns. The drawback is that this makes extending it more
involved. I encourage anyone that doesn't need the additional power in
switch.vim to take a look at one of these two.
